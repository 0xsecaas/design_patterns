# Design Patterns in Rust

This repository is a collection of common design patterns implemented in Rust. The goal is to provide clear and concise examples of how these patterns can be applied in Rust programming, serving as a reference for developers looking to deepen their understanding of design patterns in this language.

## Structure

The repository is organized into categories of design patterns, such as:

- **Creational Patterns**: Patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, e.g., Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory.

Each pattern is implemented in its respective module under the `src/` directory.

## Usage

To explore the examples, clone the repository and navigate to the `src/` directory. Each pattern is self-contained and can be run independently.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/0xsecaas/design_patterns

# Navigate to the project directory
cd design_patterns

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests to add new patterns or improve existing ones.
